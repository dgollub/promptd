# promptd

## What the?

promptd is a set of tools for shell prompts.
It currently has two parts:

- `promptd-path`, which prints a [fish](http://fishshell.com/)-like shortening
  of your current directory.

- `promptd-vcs`, which uses glyphs to give you a quick overview of your Git
  Unlike existing solutions such as the
  [vcs_info](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/User-Contributions.html#Gathering-information-from-version-control-systems)
  plugin for ZSH, `promptd-vcs` stops running after a user-specified amount of
  time, so that fetching the status of your repo doesn't make your prompt laggy.

Together, you can use them to build a prompt like this:

More to follow.

## Why is it called promptd?

It's a prompt that gives the current <em>d</em>irectory.
Or it's a prompt written in [D](http://dlang.org).
Or I suck at naming things.
Take your pick.

## How do I get it?

Linux builds can be found at the
[releases](https://github.com/mrkline/promptd/releases) page.
They haven't been tested extensively across many distros,
but Probably Workâ„¢ since they only depend on vanilla C libraries
(pthread, libm, librt, libc).

Alternatively, building form source is simple.

## How do I build it?

Grab a [D compiler](http://dlang.org/download.html) and run `make release`.
That's all.

promptd will be added as a [Dub](http://code.dlang.org) package soon-ish.

## It's 2015. Why are you generating a prompt with a compiled program?

I was using zsh with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
but it seemed to be really slow in some cases and someone on Reddit
[suggested not using it](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/pvbfp/zsh_a_bash_alternative_thats_easily_customizable/c3smc2d).
I could try [the fork](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto),
but I figured it wouldn't hurt to slim down my zsh config
to things I actually use.
After doing that, all that remained was having a decent prompt.
I wanted something like what fish offers, and since I'm allergic
to writing a shell script more than five lines long
([ew](http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/2009/msg00415.html))
I [bashed](http://instantrimshot.com/) something out in D.
Similarly, the things I might add to the prompt seem easier in a "real"
programming language instead of a zsh script.

## What additions are planned?

- Support for additional VCSes, starting with SVN and Mercurial

- Additional Git info (such as the name of a branch being merged)

- Colorized path output
